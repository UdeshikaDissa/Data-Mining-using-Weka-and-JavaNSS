# Data-Mining-using-Weka-and-JavaNSS
The modern world is full of data, however mostly the vital information and insights are hidden within the data sets itself. The data sets are meaningless unless the information and knowledge are mined out of it. Data mining is one of the key disciplines in data science that unleash the potential of obtaining useful insights, unknown patterns, and knowledge discoveries from collected data. In simple term “Data Mining enables data-driven solutions for real-world problems”. As the technologies such as IoT, 5G, Cloud Computing are advancing in rapidly phase, the amount of data collected from users and sensors are exponentially increasing. Hence, the opportunities to apply data mining are also increasing.   In this study, an easy use and zero code data mining toolkits such as weka and JavaNSS to find interesting and useful patterns in the data sets.
